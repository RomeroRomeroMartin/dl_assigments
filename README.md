# Deep Learning Practices (Master in Artificial Intelligence)

This repository contains the practices developed in the Deep Learning course of the Master in Artificial Intelligence. Each practice is in a separate folder and covers different techniques and architectures of deep neural networks. Below is the content of each practice:

## Repository Content

- `p1`: Practice 1 - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
- `p2`: Practice 2 - Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for prediction problem for time series
- `p2_2`: Practice 2_2 - Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to solve a text classification problem
- `p3`: Practice 3 - Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)

Each folder contains the Jupyter Notebook files with the developed code, as well as the corresponding results and analysis.

## General Instructions

To run the practices, it is necessary to have the appropriate Python libraries installed, mainly TensorFlow, Keras, and other dependencies detailed in the respective notebooks. It is recommended to use a Python virtual environment to manage the dependencies in isolation.
