# Practice 2 - Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)

## Objective

To develop different recurrent neural network models to solve a time series prediction problem using the Walmart sales dataset.

## Dataset

The "Walmart Sales Dataset" will be used, which contains information about the weekly sales of 45 stores from 2010-2012. The dataset includes factors affecting sales such as holidays, temperature, fuel price, CPI, and unemployment.

## Tasks Performed

1. **Dataset Generation and Preprocessing:**
   - Creating time series for training and testing.
   - Normalizing the values.

2. **Development of RNN Models:**
   - Implementing various RNN models, including LSTM and GRU layers.
   - Experimenting with different architectures and hyperparameters.

3. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Evaluating performance using the MAE metric.
   - Denormalizing MAE to interpret the results.

## Execution Instructions

The notebooks are designed to be run in a Jupyter environment with TensorFlow and Keras libraries. Ensure these dependencies are installed before running the notebooks.
