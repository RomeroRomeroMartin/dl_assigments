# Practice 1 - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

## Objective

The objective of this practice is to develop several convolutional neural network models to predict the type of animal given its image.

## Dataset

The "Animals dataset" will be used, which contains approximately 15,000 images of five types of animals: cats, dogs, elephants, horses, and lions. The dataset can be downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/antobenedetti/animals/data).

## Tasks Performed

1. **Dataset Preprocessing:**
   - Splitting into training, validation, and test sets.
   - Normalizing the images and transforming the labels.

2. **Development of a Custom Convolutional Model:**
   - Creating a convolutional network from scratch.
   - Tuning hyperparameters and regularizing to avoid overfitting.

3. **Using Pretrained Models:**
   - Implementing feature extraction and fine-tuning strategies using pretrained models.

4. **Results Comparison:**
   - Comparative analysis of the developed models and discussion of the obtained results.

## Execution Instructions

To run the notebooks, ensure that the necessary libraries are installed, mainly TensorFlow and Keras. The notebooks are prepared to be executed in a Jupyter environment.
